Palmiano and So ( DSA Heaps -  Race Track Themed Heaps )


Title: The Race Track 
Theme: Manage the race cars on the track using heaps to sort and prioritize them by lap times!

Learning Goals:
By completing this project, participants will learn to:

Master insertion and deletion in heaps:
Insert cars into a heap and maintain the heap property.
Remove the top car (highest priority) efficiently.
Implement the Heapify operation:
Reorganize the heap when the heap property is violated after an operation.
Convert between Min-Heap and Max-Heap:
Convert a Min-Heap into a Max-Heap and vice versa to prioritize cars based on fastest or slowest lap times.
Understand the structure and behavior of heaps:
Learn how heaps are structured as binary trees and how to maintain heap properties through heapify operations.

Tasks:
Insert cars with their lap times into a Min-Heap (for fastest cars) and display the heap after each addition.
Convert the Min-Heap into a Max-Heap (for identifying slowest cars).
Heapify a random list of lap times into a Min-Heap.
